class NuclearOperationsLogic(GenericLogic):
    """ A higher order logic, which combines several lower class logic modules
        in order to perform measurements and manipulations of nuclear spins.

    DISCLAIMER:
    ===========

    This module has two major issues:
        - a lack of proper documentation of all the methods
        - usage of tasks is not implemented and therefore direct connection to
          all the modules is used (I tried to compress as good as possible all
          the part, where access to other modules occurs so that a later
          replacement would be easier and one does not have to search throughout
          the whole file.)

    The state of this module is considered to be UNSTABLE.

    I am currently working on that and will from time to time improve the status
    of this module. So if you want to use it, be aware that there might appear
    drastic changes.
